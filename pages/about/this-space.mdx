## What's this all about?
Welcome to **My digital Garden!**

I attempt to understand and learn the world 
around me by writing here. It's a personal collection of notes. This idea is inspired from 
[Joel Hooks' digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).

In his own words:
> The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.

I've been that curious child, who never ceased asking questions. And I can say that my journey have been wonderful till here.

I write here to document my learnings, journey and the observations I find intriguing and thought-provoking. And also my notes from Software development, Designing, Creative Writing and BOOKS!

## Why you should read?

As a Generalist and a tireless learner, I keep uncovering and gaining experience. 
I plan, write and execute my ambitions; whether they result in a failure or a success, 
I'm learning from them.

I want to share the best of them with you.
