## [D.A.M.P.](https://devfolio.co/submissions/damp-dd4c)
<Para desc="Jul 2021 - Aug 2021" />

D.A.M.P. is a DeFi protocol, which stands for *Decentralized Asset Management Protocol*.

It provides the decentralized solution of Mutual Funds. Here, people can stream their tokens to pools of their choice, and let advanced users
(managers) handle where to invest those crypto-tokens from those pools. 

D.A.M.P. is a DeFi Protocol we (Team Hackmen) built at [ETHOdyssey Hackathon](https://ethodyssey.devfolio.co/). 
Fortunately, we won the the Chainlink and The Graph Protocol Bounties ðŸ’°ðŸ’¸.

### My contribution
I did the Frontend and smart-contracts integration. We only had a month to build it and it was my first Hackathon, so I was anxious.
- I used [Next](https://nextjs.org/) + [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) to create frontend. We had to build and ship within couple weeks, hence chose this stack to scale up.
- Used [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.2/) and [Moralis](https://moralis.io/) for contracts and Wallet integration. 
- Used [Superfluid](https://superfluid.finance/) for streaming tokens from investors to the Token pools. This was the harest part becuase of the lack of clear documentations and tutorials.

TweepsBook is an enhanced bookmarking tool for power Twitter users. It helps you streamline the clutter by adding different tags, and organize bookmarked tweets. With TweepsBook, your time is well spent learning.

### My contribution
I designed the UI/UX and helped building the frontend.
- I completed the designs of Landing Page and Dashboard using Figma.
- First we built it using React and Styled-Components.
- Later, things didn't go well, and eventually shifted to Vanilla JS when Shashikanth joined me and Ansh.
- Successfully launched it on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tweepsbook-capture-organize-learn).
