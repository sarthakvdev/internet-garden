# ✨ Hello

I'm Sarthak, I'm a frontend developer.<br></br>
I've experienced building WebApps using technologies like React, Next, Redux-Saga, Tailwind CSS and Chakra UI.

I spend most of my coding time writing logic or styling elements. When I'm not coding, I'm reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83877949-sarthak), watching [movies](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur71194765/ratings) or [meeting](https://cal.com/sarthakv/30min) interesting people.

Exploring Web3 as hell. Blockchain is revolutionary and it's changing the way we use and own assets on the Internet.

> Currently Learning `TypeScript`, `Node/Express.js` and `building dApps`.
