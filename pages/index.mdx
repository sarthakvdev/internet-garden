# ✨ Hello

I'm Sarthak, I'm a frontend developer.<br></br>
I've experienced building WebApps using technologies like React, Next, Redux-Saga, Tailwind CSS and Chakra UI.

I spend most of my coding time writing logic or styling elements. When I'm not coding, I'm reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83877949-sarthak), watching [movies](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur71194765/ratings) or [meeting](https://cal.com/sarthakv/30min) interesting people.

Exploring & into Web3 as hell. Blockchain is revolutionary and can change the way we use and own assets on the Internet.

> Currently Learning `Node/Express.js`, `Databases` and `build dApps`.

### Project Highlight 👨🏻‍💻    
I've worked on some proper side-projects, the ones which I'm proud are -

- [BuyMeCoffee on Crypto](https://github.com/sarthakvdev/bmc-crypto-client) - `WIP`
- [D.A.M.P.](https://devfolio.co/submissions/damp-dd4c) - It's a DeFi Protocol, which provided decentralized solution of Mutual Funds. This was our entry for [ETHOdyssey Hackathon](https://ethodyssey.devfolio.co/). 
- [Magical Waveland DApp](https://waveland.vercel.app/) -  It’s a place where anyone on the internet can learn a little about you and send you a 👋 w/ a message. That data is saved on the Ethereum blockchain through Smart Contract.
- [MyEpicNFT DApp](https://github.com/sarthakvdev/MyEpicNFT) - You can mint your NFT and actually own it. Everything's is on Ethereum Network. You'll even be able to re-sell the NFT on OpenSea.
