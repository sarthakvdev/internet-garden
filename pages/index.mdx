# ✨ Hello

I am a Frontend Developer. Currently exploring Backend technologies & Blockchain. I want to build products and my skill-set in this space.

I've experienced building WebApps using frontend technologies like React.js & Next.js. For styling, I've used Tailwind CSS & Chakra UI. 

Currently, I'm very interested in levelling up my Backend, System Design and Smart-Contract skills.<br></br>
Learning `TypeScript`, `Redux-Saga`, `SQL` and `Solidity`.

### Project Highlight 👨🏻‍💻    
I've worked on some proper side-projects, some of them are:

- [D.A.M.P.](https://devfolio.co/submissions/damp-dd4c) - It's a DeFi Protocol. It provides decentralized solution of Mutual Funds. We shipped this at Devfolio's ETHOdyssey Hackathon. 
- [Magical Waveland DApp](https://waveland.vercel.app/) -  It’s a place where anyone on the internet can learn a little about you and send you a 👋 w/ a message. That data will be saved on blockchain through an Ethereum Smart Contract.
- [MyEpicNFT DApp](https://github.com/sarthakvdev/MyEpicNFT) - Connect your Ethereum wallet => mint an NFT to your wallet => actually own it. You'll even be able to re-sell the NFT on OpenSea. The NFT itself can be customized to whatever you want.
- [Covi-Detection App](https://github.com/ris3abh/Covid_19) - Built this for Minor project in College. Predicts the Covid-19 Symptoms by uploading X-Ray of patient.
