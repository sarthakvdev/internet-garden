- Don't use any wallet you come across, don't use shady wallets.
- Don't enter your seed pharse. Keep it safe.

> Simple rule to remember - Not your keys? Not your crypto.

### Q. If WazirX or binance have wallets too, then why to make separate wallet?
 Ans. Yes, they have. But they don't give you seed phrases. So, if tomorrow they get shut down, you will loose your assets.
 Hence, use one of these wallets too.
 
 You can keep it on WazirX, but you can have MetaMask. You need later to buy NFTs.

You need to pay = `amount of that NFT` + `gas fee`

## What is Gas fees?
Basically, its a fee you need to pay to send your transaction through the ethereum network.
This money goes to the network. Miner get this money.

**Etherscan:** It's a blockchain explorer.
