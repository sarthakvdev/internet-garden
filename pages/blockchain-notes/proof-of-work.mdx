## Introduction / TL;DR
Proof-of-work (POW) is a consensus protocol. It allows the nodes of the network to agree on the state of all information recorded on that blockchain. It prevents certain kinds of economic attacks.
- Blockchains like [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) uses it.
- It is the first Consensus Mechanism.

> Make sure you have an understanding of transactions, consensus mechanism and blocks, before going further.

## Understanding Better
On Blockchain, unlike a centralized model, if some transaction is done, all the miners check if it is true. If one person says that you owe them $10k, that will be a fraud, coz everyone else will falsify him.
Everyone (miners) have the same record. That's a distributed ledger.

Proof of Work is:
- reliable
- fair
- transparent

> Fact: It was launched in 2009 for bitcoin, for solving the issue of "Double Spending". 

## How POW works?
Miners spend a ton of time thinking about the hash code of the block, it's where the pow comes in. You have proof that you spent a long time trying to find the password that works. In the reward, the miner gets some $BTC according to the complexity of the hash they solve. Then all the transactions in that block are validated and the record of everyone in that network are updated to the new blocks.

### Features:
- Secure: Reliable, Safe, Permanent, Fair and transparent
- To do a fraudulent transaction, you need to own 51% of the network's power. It's impossible. Because for owning 51% of the network the hardware cost would be off the charts.
- Consensus: Everyone has the same records, they need to complete every other miner to get rewards. When they find the password, they share it with others so they can add it to their ledgers.

### Problems:
- Impact on the environment
- Inability to scale
	- The transaction time is low. 1 block/10mins.
	- This brings us to pay large amounts of gas fees.
- No Penalties
	- Miners with intent to malicious fraud are not punished

## Blockchain projects that follow POW are:
- ETH
- Litecoin
- BTC Cash
- Manero
